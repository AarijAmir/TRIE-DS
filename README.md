Implemented TRIE-DS in Dart.
<br>
A TRIE, also known as a prefix tree, is a data structure that allows for efficient searching and retrieval of strings. It's commonly used in applications that involve storing and searching for words or strings. The TRIE organizes the data in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a character in a string. This allows for fast lookup and retrieval of words or prefixes. It's often used in tasks like autocomplete, spell checkers, and search engines.
